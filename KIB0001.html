<h1>KIB 0001: The Dragon Mold</h1>

<p>Danger: Unknown</p>
<p>On his fourth day working for us, a package for Agent Vixen came in the mail. He claims to know where it came from now, but according to the label on the box, it is a mold of a dragon's claw. This mold is silicon and has Evil Dragon engraved on the base. It is approximately 13 inches long and 2 inches in circumference. There seems to be some form of alluring factor to the claw that has infected Agent Vixen. Whenever the agents or I am not looking, Agent Vixen is caught trying to steal KIB 1 and take it home. We have taken this precaution by changing the lock to a code I only know. Despite this, Agent Vixen keeps requesting time alone with the claw, but due to safety regulations and us not knowing what dangers this claw could pose, we must avoid this test for now.</p>
