<h1>KIB0004: Play Box that chooses its owner</h1>
<p>Danger: None</p>
<p>Permissions: N/A</p>
<p class="story">KIB0004 is a PlayBox that was recently brought to the foundation. This PlayBox does not work whenever I wish to play on it, but it somehow works when the other agents do. KIB0004 resides in the KIB Foundation Breakroom and is often tested regularly by the agents. Despite fully functioning while they are around when I am handed a controller from one of the agents, it does not seem to activate a fifth player. Agent Marley has been the primary user of KIB0004, and whenever I request to test it, he states, "It is not my turn to play," when he or any agent hands me a controller, the controller does not work. I have given up testing his phenomenon for now, but it is a bit disheartening that I do not get to play any games on KIB0004.</p>
<p>KIB0004 is a video game console released by Play Play in the year 2124. PlayBox has recently experienced a shortage in supply, and it is currently in high demand. Having acquired one for the facility is an analogy in itself, but the one that has been brought to the facility has obtained semi-sentient properties.</p>
