<h1>KIB0006: Soccer Boy</h1>
<p>Danger: Neutral</p>
<p>Permissions: Free</p>
<p class="story">KIB0006 is a grown man seen downtown of the facility standing at the curb of Union City National Park’s soccer field. KIB0006 is a 38-year-old man dressed in a kid’s soccer uniform. KIB0006 is 230lbs 5’8” and his clothing is dramatically undersized for his build. KIB0006 has blond hair and brown eyes. KIB0006’s hygiene is poor, but he seems to bathe in the river that runs through town when given the opportunity. KIB’s diet usually consists of Class E-D rations when the Foundation can provide them or will take handouts from the local population. KIB0006’s demeanor is childlike, often talking with a high pitches tone and will engauge in conversation like someone that is arround eight years old, and he is content with its circumstances.</p>
<p class="story">When asked, KIB0006 is waiting for his parents to pick him up from soccer practice and has not seen them in a long time. We have identified the parents of KIB0006, code-named KIB0006a, his supposed father. KIB0006a is a retired Tractor Mechanic currently residing at the Close to Heaven Retirement home. KIB0006a has no recollection of KIB0006.</p>
<p class="story">KIB0006a suffers from low mental capabilities and a severe case of memory loss. Likely, KIB0006 is somehow feeding off of his target’s mental capabilities in order to extend his life. We have enticed KIB0006 with D Class rations and have been successful at communicating with KIB0006; however, he refuses to comply with our request for him to stay at the facility at this time. It is unlikely that forcing KIB0006 to comply will result in combat, but we have determined that until KIB0006 is deemed dangerous, we will grant them free permissions at this time.</p>
