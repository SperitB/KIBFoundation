<h1>KIB 0003 Neko Girls</h1>
<p>Danger: Global</p>
<p>Permissions: Free</p>
<p class="story">Neko girls are a humanoid cat race that has recently appeared in Japan over the past 50 years. Not much has been recorded of these Neko Girls. Neko Girls are an all-female race, and they do not know where they originated or who their parents are. Neko Girls have an extreme level of strength compared to humans and can perform between levels 1 – 2 on the Tune scale.</p>
<p class="story">Speaking to Neko girls is often seen as embarrassing because of their developmentally challenged manner of speaking. Despite being fluent in Japanese and English, the Neko Girls are terrible at speaking both and will mix unnecessary words from both languages when speaking either language. Neko girls often misunderstand people's intentions towards them and completely misunderstand anything a human says. Neko girls often imprint on a human they spend a lot of time with and constantly harass that human to gain their attention. Despite this, Neko girls will be completely unresponsive to any reciprocation of their feelings toward their target. Nekogirls almost exclusively talk about Anime and other forms of Japanese media. Almost all conversations with a Neko girl will be steered toward their preferred topic.</p>

<p>Agent Brash: “So miss Nekokoko San… What is it that you want?"</p>
<p>Nekokoko San: "Um…" *KIB0002 spends an uncomfortable amount of time fidgeting in her chair*</p>
<p>Agent Brash: "Hey boss, I've been here for like 20 minutes, and she is not saying shit. I am gonna clock out soon."</p>
<p>Nekokoko San: "Uh, wait, you can't go."</p>
<p>Agent Brash: "Holy shit, you made a complete sentence. Don't hurt yourself by thinking too hard." *Agent Brash Moves to leave the interview.</p>
<p>Nekokoko San: *Begins to become visibly frustrated* "Wait, you cannot leave. I have no friends, and I have nowhere to go after the death of my parents in my tragic backstory."</p>
<p>Agent Brash: "No, no, you are like the 5th one that has said that an evil Neko killed ur family, and you are all alone. Every single time you guys say this shit to guilt us into staying overtime with you."</p>
<p>*Nekokoko San ended the interview, storming out of the room crying*</p>
<p>John Strange: "Good Job. Do you know that they are retarded or something? You can't just yell at them because they all make terrible backstories for themselves."</p>
<p>Agent Brash: "Look, man, we have been through this too many times. Every time I stay, they try to touch me inappropriately. If you want that weird shit, get Agent Klinger to do it.</p>
<p>Agent Klinger: "Oh, do I get to interview for the next one? I want that cute one that goes to the gym downtown."</p>
