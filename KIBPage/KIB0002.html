<h1>KIB 0002: Funny Little Creature</h1>

<p>Danger: Neutral</p>
<p>Permissions: Field</p>
<p class="story">KIB 0002 is a Funny Little Creature. Everyone Loves KIB002, and he always seems to run around the compound, making weird noises and getting into mischief. KIB0002 is a small green animal-like blob that stands at around 2'4" â€“ 2'8" and weighs approximately 70-80 lbs. Obtaining an accurate measurement of KIB0002 is nearly impossible due to its squirming nature when held. KIB0002 is to be given Class D Rations and can be offered Class C if they do not break anything that week. KIB0002 allows a set of wooden blocks in his chamber and a toy truck that he uses to deliver the blocks to the other KIBs.</p>

<p>John Strange:<p>
<p>Despite being harmless, under no circumstances should KIB0002 be given a firearm. Seriously, guys, I know whoever did it will never confess, but he punched three holes into the walls of his cage. KIB0002 was convinced to return the weapon in exchange for chicken nuggets.</p>
<p>If KIB0002 is given another firearm, his danger level will immediately be lifted to "personnel," and he will be handled at that level.</p>
